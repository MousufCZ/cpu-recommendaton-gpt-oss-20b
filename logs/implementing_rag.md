Perfect! You’re essentially moving into a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** setup for your CPU recommendation system. Let’s break down what you want to do and the best workflow:

---

## 1. **What you want to do**

* You have two types of content:

  1. **Articles / PDFs** → text sources about CPU selection.
  2. **Final dataset CSV** → structured knowledge about CPUs (your version 5).
* You want to ingest these into a **vector database** (Chroma) for semantic search later.
* You’ll use **LangChain document loaders** to read and process these documents.

---

## 2. **Steps in a RAG pipeline**

### a. Load Documents

* PDFs → Use `PyPDFLoader`, `UnstructuredPDFLoader`, or `PDFPlumberLoader`.
* CSV → Use `CSVLoader` or `Pandas` + `TextSplitter`.
* Optional: If you have plain text articles, you can just read them with `TextLoader`.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader, CSVLoader

pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader("cpu_selection_articles.pdf")
pdf_docs = pdf_loader.load()

csv_loader = CSVLoader(file_path="cpu_benchmarks_v5.csv", csv_args={"delimiter": ","})
csv_docs = csv_loader.load()
```

---

### b. Split Documents into Chunks

* This is crucial for embedding because models have **token limits**.
* Use `CharacterTextSplitter` or `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
pdf_chunks = splitter.split_documents(pdf_docs)
csv_chunks = splitter.split_documents(csv_docs)
```

---

### c. Embed the Content

* Convert each chunk into a **vector embedding** for semantic search.
* Example using OpenAI embeddings:

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

---

### d. Store in a Vector Database

* Chroma is your database for vectorized content.
* Insert all your embeddings:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(pdf_chunks + csv_chunks, embeddings, collection_name="cpu_data")
```

* Later, when querying, you can retrieve relevant chunks for your LLM to reason over.

---

### e. Querying

* When a user asks, your RAG system:

  1. Converts the query to embeddings.
  2. Searches Chroma for top-k nearest chunks.
  3. Feeds them to the LLM for an informed answer.

```python
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("Best CPU for multi-threaded server workloads?")
```

---

## ✅ Key Notes / Things to Keep in Mind

1. **Preprocessing matters**

   * PDFs often contain headers, footers, or broken lines → cleaning improves embeddings.
   * CSVs: You may want to convert rows into textual descriptions before embedding (e.g., `"AMD EPYC 7713P has 64 cores, TDP 225W, CPU mark 45860"`).

2. **Chunk size**

   * Smaller chunks → more granular retrieval but more storage and API cost.
   * Too large chunks → may exceed LLM token limits and reduce relevance.

3. **Embeddings**

   * OpenAI is common (`text-embedding-ada-002`), but OSS embeddings like `InstructorEmbeddings` or `SentenceTransformers` work too.

4. **Vector database**

   * Chroma, Weaviate, Pinecone, Milvus, FAISS are options. Chroma is lightweight and local.

5. **Versioning**

   * Keep separate collections for different data types (articles vs dataset) for clarity.

---

So you’re **not missing anything major**, just make sure:

* CSV rows are converted to meaningful text chunks.
* PDFs are cleanly processed.
* Embeddings are applied **after chunking**, not before.

---

If you want, I can **write a ready-to-run Python script** that:

1. Loads your CSV and PDFs.
2. Chunks them.
3. Embeds them.
4. Stores them in Chroma for your CPU RAG system.

Do you want me to do that next?
